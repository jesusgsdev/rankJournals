# Exercise
You should implement the following features using Java. There is no need to persist any data to a database or to build a user interface. You should prove your code works by unit testing it to cover the features listed below. Automating your unit testing with Maven or Ant would be preferable. You have been asked to add a new feature which provides the ability to rank journals.

## Feature: Rank journals
In order to highlight the journals which have the biggest impact in a given year
As a user
I want to be able to see journals ordered by their score across a range of years. If two or more journals have the same score they should be assigned the same rank, ordering within a rank should be done alphabetically on the journalâ€™s name.

## Scenario 1: Rank journals
Given the following journals have scores for 2015:
Journal A = 5.6, Journal B = 2.4, Journal C = 3.1
When the user views the ranked journals
Then the order and rank should be:

|Rank|Journal|Score|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|1|Journal A|5.6|
|2|Journal C|3.1|
|3|Journal B|2.4|

## Scenario 2: Rank journals with a shared rank
Given the following journals have scores for 2014:
Journal A = 2.2, Journal B = 6.2, Journal C = 6.2
When the user views the ranked journals
Then the order should be determined by score then journal name:

|Rank|Journal|Score|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|1|Journal B|6.2|
|1|Journal C|6.2|
|3|Journal A|2.2|

## Scenario 3: Rank journals excluding review journals
Given the following journals have scores for 2013:
Journal A = 5.6, Journal B = 2.4, Journal C = 3.1
And Journal A is a review journal
When the journals are ranked
Then the order should be:

|Rank|Journal|Score|
| ------------- |:--------:| -----:|
|1|Journal C|3.1|
|2|Journal B|2.4|
